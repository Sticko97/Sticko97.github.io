    <h1>Activity #1: Explain what is Blue/Green deployment</h1>
    <p>Blue/Green deployment is an application release model that transfers user traffic in increments. The user traffic is obtained from the previous version of an app or microservice of a similar or nearly identical new release, both running in production.</p>
    <p>Old version is <span style="color: blue;">Blue</span><br>
       New version is <span style="color: green;">Green</span></p>
    <p>Once data is fully transferred from Blue to Green, Blue can be thought of as a snapshot, a precaution that allows us to rollback data to a past version.</p>

    <h1>Activity #2: List out 3 remote host solutions with a short explanation</h1>
    <p>Remote hosting is a method for delivering software applications, databases, and files to users from remote servers that are housed off-site in data centers.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>AWS:</strong> Offers a scalable and adaptable infrastructure for hosting data, other services, and web applications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Azure:</strong> Provides a variety of cloud services, including virtual machines, databases, AI and machine learning tools, and services geared at developers, such as Azure DevOps.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Digital Ocean:</strong> Provides cloud computing resources including managed databases, Kubernetes, and virtual private servers (Droplets).
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Activity #3: Explain what is Rolling deployment</h1>
    <p>A rolling deployment is a deployment technique that totally updates the infrastructure that the program is operating on in order to gradually replace older versions of an application with newer versions.</p>

    <h1>Activity #4: Explain what is Canary deployment</h1>
    <p>A canary deployment is a gradual rollout of an application that divides traffic between an existing version and a new version, pushing it out to a select group of users before rolling it out to all users.</p>

    <h1>Activity #5: Explain what is In-place deployment</h1>
    <p>Allows you to deploy your application without building new infrastructure; however, during these deployments, your application's availability may be impacted. Additionally, this strategy reduces the administrative burden and infrastructural expenditures related to generating new resources.</p>
