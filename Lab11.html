    <h1>Part 1: Question: did you see big improvement? Why?</h1>
    <p>With CDN the output was faster by 4ms</p>

    <h1>What is CDN?</h1>
    <p>CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a network of servers distributed geographically to deliver web content, 
        such as images, stylesheets, JavaScript, and videos, to users. The goal is to improve the performance, reliability, 
        and efficiency of content delivery by reducing latency and optimizing the transfer of data.</p>
    
    <h1>How does CDN work in your own words?</h1>
    <p>CDN works by strategically placing servers, known as edge servers or nodes,
        in various locations worldwide. When a user requests content, 
        the CDN automatically directs the request to the nearest edge server rather than the origin server where the content is stored. 
        This reduces the physical distance the data must travel, minimizing latency and speeding up the delivery of content. Additionally, 
        CDNs often cache content, 
        storing copies of it on multiple servers, further enhancing performance.</p>

    <h1>List out 10 different CDN providers</h1>

        <li>Cloudflare</li>
        <li>Amazon CloudFront</li>
        <li>Fastly</li>
        <li>MaxCDN</li>
        <li>KeyCDN</li>
        <li>Microsoft Azure CDN</li>
        <li>Rackspace CDN</li>

    <h1>Is CDN for performance, or availability?</h1>
    <p>CDNs primarily enhance performance by reducing latency and accelerating the delivery of web content. 
        While they indirectly contribute to availability by distributing content across multiple servers and providing redundancy, 
        their primary purpose is to optimize the speed and efficiency of content delivery.</p>

    <h1>List pros and cons of CDNs</h1>
    <h2>Pros</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Improved Performance: CDNs reduce latency and speed up content delivery, leading to faster load times for websites and applications.</li>
        <li>Global Reach: CDNs have servers distributed worldwide, improving content access for users regardless of their location.</li>
        <li>Scalability: CDNs can handle increased traffic and distribute the load, preventing server overloads.</li>
        <li>Reliability: By caching content on multiple servers, CDNs provide redundancy and reduce the risk of server failures affecting content availability.</li>
        <li>Security: Some CDNs offer security features, such as DDoS protection and web application firewalls.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cons</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cost: Premium CDN services can be expensive, especially for large-scale usage.</li>
        <li>Configuration Complexity: Setting up and configuring a CDN may require technical expertise.</li>
        <li>Potential Cache Issues: Caching can lead to outdated content being served in some cases. Developers must manage cache settings carefully.</li>
        <li>Dependency: Relying on a CDN means your content delivery is dependent on the CDN provider's infrastructure. If the CDN experiences issues, it can affect your content delivery.</li>
        <li>Limited Control: Some CDNs may limit certain customization options, restricting fine-tuning for specific requirements.</li>
    </ul>

            // Example: Change the text color of paragraphs to red
            $('p').css('color', 'teal');
